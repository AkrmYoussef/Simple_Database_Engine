in M1 :

2 -  I think that the vector<row> in page should be initialized with max no.rows allowed in one page as input to its constructor, to increase performance

3 - important : should write table info in meta data when createing table!

3 (Done)- throw exception in create table if the 3 hashtables don't have exactly the same keys

4 - important :  Meta data file should be used to learn about TYPES of columns, as well check if inserted value is between column min and max in a table with every insert/delete/update,for example, in insert, it only checks for exsistance of table name in listofCreated tables,but doesn't check columns and compare their types with input parameters !

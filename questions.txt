1 - When searching using the index should all 3 columns that are indexed be queried or the existence of 1 or 2 columns should be handled as well?
2 - should we consider the precedance between AND, OR ,XOR in selectFromTable() ?
3 - when quering using the index, will index columns come directly one after the other in arrSQLTerms or can there be other columns in between?

 TA questions : 

 1 - use index with 1 or 2 columns?
 2 - precedance between AND, OR ,XOR ? if no , then : 
    (we only search for an AND Chain whose start is the beginning of the SqlOperators)
    a - there is no term between the 3 index columns than is not anded with them
    b - the first index column must be ANDed with the term directly before it(which will be the result of all the previous SqlTerms)
    am I right ?
